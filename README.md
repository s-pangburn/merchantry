Merchantry!
===========

A simple merchant game I created for a two-week university project. You play as an ordinary sandal merchant peddling his goods to make rent.

The concept and design is mine, only requirement was a console grid. I ended up liking the result a whole lot so I'm posting it here for possible iterations and code cleanup in the future.

Be warned, this code is kind of old though. I will clean it up when I have time.
